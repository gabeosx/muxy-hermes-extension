# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-08-16)

**Core value:** Prove secure, authenticated, streamed Hermes run control across representative Hermes deployment shapes inside a native-feeling Muxy panel before building the surrounding product.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 1]: Use one deployment-neutral URL/token client contract for host-native, Docker, SSH local-forward, direct HTTPS, and remote Muxy workspace evidence.
- [Phase 1]: Direct WebKit transport produced a negative result; v1 now uses one consented argv-form curl process per SSE stream and a bounded workspace journal.
- [Phase 1]: V1 is extension-only; Muxy agent/provider registration and all Muxy source changes remain deferred.
- [Phase 3]: Rich run ownership exists only while the panel and sole SSE subscriber remain attached; status/final output can be reconciled, but missed events and approval detail cannot.
- [Phase 01]: Plan 01-01 leaves real Muxy controlled-fixture streaming Not verified and qualification Unverified until Plan 01-04.
- [Phase 01]: Plan 01-01 ships a permissionless declarative panel with no background entry.
- [Phase 01]: Bearer material crosses only exec stdin and is forbidden in argv, URL, environment, journal, storage, diagnostics, and audit summaries.
- [Phase ?]: Render capability names strictly as read-only data; no capability creates a Phase 1 control.
- [Phase ?]: Adapt stale TypeScript plan paths to the existing JavaScript panel scaffold.
- [Phase ?]: Evidence persists only allowlisted projections and SHA-256 shape hashes; raw transport observations remain ephemeral.
- [Phase 01]: Detailed closed-panel notifications, provider registration, and every Muxy/Hermes source change remain deferred.
- [Phase ?]: Use a fail-closed evidence matrix: only reproducible fresh real-path origin or stream failures, or an explicit change signal, activate the Muxy-change stop gate.
- [Phase ?]: Keep simulated SSH, direct HTTPS, and remote-workspace evidence Unverified at the panel projection boundary.
- [Phase ?]: Use one cancellable execAsync owner for SSE and await its cleanup before panel release.
- [Phase ?]: Derive diagnostics only from observed curl, HTTP, parser, journal, or cancellation outcomes.
- [Phase ?]: Receipt generation is opt-in through a verifier-owned fixed challenge file and otherwise leaves production panel sessions without a receipt.
- [Phase ?]: Receipt correlation uses SHA-256 digests of relay observations, never raw execution, endpoint, journal, secret, or stream content.
- [Phase ?]: Only a 2xx authenticated terminal stream with awaited successful cleanup is support-eligible.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Actual Muxy consent prompts, file.changed delivery, incremental relay rendering, audit-token absence, and stale-journal cleanup still require real-panel verification before real user run content.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 1 edited: Aligned DEPL-04 through DEPL-06 and Phase 1 success criteria with 01-CONTEXT.md D-08

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Muxy integration | Agent/provider registration and any source change | Deferred — requires separate authorization | v1 initialization |
| Durable operation | Token persistence, background run ownership, and notifications | Deferred — needs a distinct trust model | v1 initialization |
| Workspace execution | `cwd` and workspace path mapping | Deferred — needs Gateway-side validation | v1 initialization |
